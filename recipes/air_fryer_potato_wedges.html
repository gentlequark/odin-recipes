    <h3>Perfectly crisp and seasoned potato wedges straight out of your air fryer. It doesn't get any easier than this!    </h3>

    <p>The easiest way to wedge a potato is to start by cutting it in half lengthwise. 
        Place each half flesh-side down on the cutting board and cut each half lengthwise again. 
        You will end up with 4 large wedges at this point. Cut each wedge in half lengthwise
         giving you a total of 8 wedges per potato</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium Russet potatoes, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of parsley flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F</li>
        <li>Place potato wedges in a large bowl. Add olive oil, paprika, parsley, chili, salt, and
            pepper and mix well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Place 8 wedges in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip wedges with tongs and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining 8 wedges.</li>
