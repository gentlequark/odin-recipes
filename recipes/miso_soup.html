    <h3>Dashi is what gives miso soup it's distinct flavor. It's a simple broth made by boiling 
        water with kombu (dried seaweed) and bonito flakes (dried fish flakes).</h3>

    <p>Miso soup’s base is a broth called dashi that is made from strips of dried kelp (kombu) 
        and dried smoked bonito flakes (katsuobushi). Miso, a salty fermented soybean paste, 
        provides that savoriness called umami as it’s whisked into the broth, giving it a 
        cloudy appearance that settles as it sits.
    </p>

    <p>The simple version of miso soup served at restaurants is sprinkled with scallions and 
       includes cubes of silken tofu as well as a different much thinner variety of seaweed 
       called wakame.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 3x5-inch piece kombu</li>
        <li> 3/4 ounce bonito flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried wakame</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup of silken tofu, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white miso</li>
        <li>1 scallion, very thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine kombu and 4 cups water in a medium saucepan. Let sit until kombu softens,
             25–30 minutes. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately remove from heat 
             once water starts simmering; fish out kombu and discard. Add bonito flakes and stir 
             once to submerge them. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat, and simmer about 5 
             minutes. Remove from heat and let steep 15 minutes (this ensures you get the most 
             flavorful broth, or dashi, possible).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine wakame and 3 Tbsp. water in a small bowl;
             let sit until wakame is softened; 10–15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain dashi (your broth) through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. 
            Discard solids, wipe out pot, and return dashi to pot. Add tofu and wakame and 
            bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Submerge sieve in liquid, add miso to sieve, 
            and stir to liquefy miso (see how to do this here), then press through strainer 
            until miso is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with scallions.</li>


    </ol>
